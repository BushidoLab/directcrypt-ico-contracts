## JCR token functionality
In order to further the development of the platform, reach breakeven and get to the global market as soon as possible we are going to raise extra funding by running an ICO campaign.

Jincor will issue 35,000,000 JCR tokens, most of which will be put on sale. The base cost of tokens will depend on the popularity of the platform, and their holders will be able to share the success of Jincor by getting permanent progressive income.

In the future, JCR tokens will be essential for the proper platform experience. Whereas it is free for organizations to use the basic functionality of Jincor ecosystem, some features will be available for a fee, which can be paid in JCR tokens only. These premium features include:

1. Digital verification of companies;
2. Setting up enterprise and individual cryptocurrency accounts;
3. Getting access to a range of financial instruments, such as bills of credit, colls, overdrafts, factoring and etc.;

Using a construction set for creating and execution of corporate smart contracts (based on labour, property, contractual and other relations);

Appealing to a decentralized arbitration system for litigation within the digital jurisdiction.
To sum up, JCR tokens will serve as a local digital currency, which can be used for paying Jincor fees and mutual corporate payments, just like any other popular cryptocurrency.

JCR token is developed on Ethereum’s blockchain and conform to the ERC20 Token Standard.
